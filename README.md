<h1>Ethan Lee's OpenCV Work</h1> 
<h2>A repository containing all the work I have done so far with the Python OpenCV library. This is mostly following <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7D1O6skqDQ-JZ1GGHKK-K" >Programming Knowledge's</a> YouTube tutorials. Thanks a lot!</h2>
<h3> Description of each py file is below: </h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>adaptive_thresh.py: </strong>applies binary thresholding and compares it to several types of adaptive thresholding on the same image</li>
  <li><strong>binary.py: </strong>demonstrates bitwise and, or, not, and xor operations</li>
  <li><strong>drawing_on_imgs.py: </strong>draws various geometric shapes, including text, onto an image</li>
  <li><strong>drawing_on_videos.py:</strong> displays the computer clock on webcam video </li>
  <li><strong>edge_detection.py:</strong> displays several types of edge detection on the same image in matplotlib, including canny edge detection
  <li><strong>image_view.py:</strong> displays a simple image with opencv in grayscale </li>
  <li><strong>matplotlib_test.py: </strong>displays an image in matplotlib and normally </li>
  <li><strong>messi.py:</strong> duplicates and moves a region of interest of an image and blends weighted images together</li>
  <li><strong>morph.py:</strong> displays the same image with several morphological transformations applied in matplotlib</li>
  <li><strong>mouseclick.py:</strong> displays an image and also displays the location (in x/y coords) where a mouseclick occurs</li>
  <li><strong>mouseclick2.py:</strong> forms a line segment from any number of points in an image where a mouseclick occurs</li>
  <li><strong>mouseclick3.py:</strong> displays the exact color of a pixel in a separate window when clicked on in an image</li>
  <li><strong>obj_detection_video.py:</strong> continuously displays parts of the webcam feed based on whether they meet the HSV value thresholds specified by the user with the trackbar</li>
  <li><strong>obj_tracking.py:</strong> displays parts of an image based on whether they meet the HSV value thresholds specified by the user with the trackbar</li>
  <li><strong>smoothing_blurring.py:</strong> performs several smoothing/blurring/filtering operations on a single image and displays using matplotlib</li>
  <li><strong>threshold.py:</strong> performs basic thresholding operations on the same image</li>
  <li><strong>threshold2.py:</strong> performs basic thresholding operations on the same image and displays using matplotlib</li>
  <li><strong>trackbar1.py:</strong> includes three trackbars that, when adjusted, results in an RGB color being displayed</li>
  <li><strong>trackbar2.py:</strong> includes one trackbar representing an arbitrary value displayed on the image, and another trackbar setting color or grayscale for the image</li>
</ul>
